# ðŸ’¾ How to use a backup
Do you want to take a break during your game ?
No worries, use the backup system.

1. Write *STOP* :
    ```
    Enter letter or word : STOP
    ```
2. **Want to start your save ?** Use this : ` --startWith save.txt` :
    ```
    -- Your save is start --
    ```
3. If a backup is present, decide whether to overwrite it or not :
    ```
    WARNING : Save was found !
    Create a new save delete the oldone.
    Continue ? [y/n]
    ```
4. When starting a game, you will be offered an option to use the save or not :
    ```
    We found a save.
    Want you to launch them ? [y/n]
    ```
